# number_guesser_java
 Number Guesser application written in Java, includes tests

# Background
In an effort to get more experience with Java, we are building a simple Number Guesser application.  This application will start as a console application where a number range will be set and the user will have a certain number of guesses to match against a randomly generated number.

# Requirements
The requirements can change over time.  For the initial version, these are the requirements:

- User must provide a minimum and maximum number for the range.
- User gets a maximum of 5 guesses
- The answer is a randomly genrated number by the system.
- If the user provides a guess that is equal to the answer within the allowed number of guesses, the user wins.
- If the user does not guess the answer within the allowed number of guesses, they lose.
- There is no time limit for guesses.
- There is no time limit for the game.
